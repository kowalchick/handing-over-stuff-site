# Handing-over stuff React App

This is a single-page react website to created to hand over unwanted stuff to those who are in need.
I created this project by using 'Create React App' command. 

### Design of the app

Design of this app is my school's property. I implemented it using Adobe XD application. In the feature I want to redesign this project to be more user-friendly (improve the accessibility). 

### Backend info

I had no access to any backend data. To mock the data I used json server. 

To start use a command: `json-server --watch ./db.json`

### State of the app

This is my first react redux app. I used Redux to implement user login and registration functionality. 

### Additional info

This project contains forms with necessary validations. Moreover, I used a few react libraries such as react-scroll, react-router-dom etc.

### Running the app 

To run the app in the development mode use `npm start`
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3001) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.
