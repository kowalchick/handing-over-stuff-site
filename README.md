# Handing-over stuff React App

## Link to the demo

Link to the demo of this site is available [here](http://localhost:3001).
This project of mine is almost done. Steps of main "handing over stuff"and its validation are missing. I'm gonna finish i soon. 
### Design of the app

Design of this app is my school's property. I implemented it using Adobe XD application. In the feature I want to redesign this project to be more user-friendly (improve the accessibility). 

### Backend info

I had no access to any backend data. To mock the data I used json server. 

To start use a command: `json-server --watch ./db.json`

### State of the app

This is my first react redux app. I used Redux to implement user login and registration functionality. 

### Additional info

This project contains forms with necessary validations. Moreover, I used a few react libraries such as react-scroll, react-router-dom etc. I used POST method of fetch API to send contact form data.
