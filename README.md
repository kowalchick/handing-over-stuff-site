# Handing-over React app

I created this project by using 'Create React App' command. 

### Design of the app

Design of this app is my school's property. I implemented it using Adobe XD application. In the feature I want to redesign this project to be more user-friendly (improve the accessibility). 

### Backend info

I had no access to any backend data. To mock the data I used json server. 

To start, use a command: `json-server --watch ./db.json`

### State of the app

This is my first react redux app. I used Redux to implement user login and registration functionality. 

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3001) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
